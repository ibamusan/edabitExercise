// With ES6, you can assign variables from arrays in a much more succinct way. 
// Create variables a and b from the given array using the ES6 destructuring assignment syntax (check the Resources tab for more examples), where a === 1 and b === 2.

const arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];

var a = arr[0];
var b = arr[1];

console.log(a,b);
